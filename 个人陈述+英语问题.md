# 自我介绍

尊敬的各位老师好，我叫xxx，本科就读于华中科技大学网络空间安全学院，专业是密码科学与技术。

在大学期间，我积极参加学校的活动，获得了明德奖学金。在英语能力方面，我通过了四六级考试，并获得了雅思7.0分。在科研实践方面，我作为大创项目的负责人，带领小组对开源的扩散模型增加差分隐私，使用了噪声多样性来使模型平滑，最终即实现了隐私的保护又能输出较高质量的图像。同时，我还自学了机器学习，在 kaggle 上完成了一个恶意软件检测模型的项目，通过使用特征工程、数据增强以及模型融合等方法，较大地提升了模型的准确性。在工程代码能力方面，我在课后实现了一个基于 linux netfilter 模块的防火墙，它的功能包括数据包过滤，NAT 转换等等。我的毕业设计是基于 GPU 的 NTT 算法设计与实现，通过阅读论文并分析 NTT 算法，我使用了线程分配与单核多核混合调用的方法来提升 NTT 的性能。

经过本科的学习，我在网络安全与密码学领域有一些基础并且对它们有浓厚的兴趣，非常希望能在复旦大学进行进一步的学习和研究。如果能有幸进入复旦大学，我会认真学习知识，积极完成老师交给我任务，并努力提升自己。以上是我的自我介绍，谢谢各位老师。

## 自我介绍

Good afternoon, professors! 

It is my honor to be here and take this interview. My name is **xxx**. I am a senior from Huazhong University of Science and Technology. And I major in **cryptography**.

During my undergrad years, I focused hard on my studies while volunteering regularly – that’s how I earned the **MingDe Scholarship**. Since I studied cybersecurity and cryptography in college, I have a solid foundation and great interest in it. I want to continue learning and researching in this field. Fudan has such a strong reputation in computer science, and I have admired Fudan for a long time. That’s why I apply here – I’d love to learn from your expertise and contribute to this field.

When it comes to my strengths, I’m super detail-oriented and reliable. When teachers assigned me tasks, I always tried my best to complete them. And I have a great desire to acquire knowledge. Outside of studying, I often play basketball and listen to music. Both help me wind down and stay creative.

That's all, thank you!

## 毕业设计（graduation thesis）

The topic of my graduation thesis /ˈθiːsɪs/ is acceleration of NTT algorithm based on GPU. I reduced the iterative /ˈɪtərətɪv/ dependency in the NTT algorithm by modifying its structure, and then I used a hybrid method of single-core and multi-core calls to accelerate the NTT algorithm.

The NTT algorithm (Number Theoretic Transform) is used to quickly multiply long polynomials. It is widely used in Fully Homomorphic Encryption.

Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) allows you to perform computations directly on encrypted data, so it can be used in scenarios like cloud computing to protect personal data privacy.

## 志愿服务（volunteer services）

During college, I was involved in lots of volunteer work. For example, I helped organize events for the Communist Party’s 100th anniversary celebrations. Another project was collecting and sorting used books from campus dorms to donate to local schools. These experiences taught me teamwork and how to stay organized even when facing multiple tasks!

## 家乡

I grew up in Shanghai, so I don't remember much about my family's hometown. Shanghai is a lively global city in eastern China. It's famous for its 'Haipai' culture that combines Chinese traditions with Western styles. Visitors love places like Yu Garden and the Nanjing Road. The city also hosts big international events, showing how East and West come together in food, art, and new ideas.

## 母校（old school）

Huazhong University of Science and Technology is in Wuhan, Hubei Province. When I first arrived, two things stood out: how huge the campus was and how green it was everywhere. The environment is really nice - I love biking along the tree-lined avenues. The teachers are dedicated in class and also super friendly to students.

## 爱好

I love playing basketball because it keeps me fit and I enjoy competing with friends. Plus, music is my way for relax - it always boosts my mood and puts me in a good vibe.

## 为什么喜欢篮球

What I really love is the teamwork. On the court, everyone has to work together, pass the ball, and support each other to win. the battle of speed and power always gets me excited and pumped.

## 缺点

One of my weaknesses is that I'm naturally shy, so I get nervous when facing a lot of people. But I'm working on it by joining more activities. Even this interview is a chance for me to practice, stepping out of my comfort zone.

## 成功

The best thing I did in college was definitely my graduation project. When I first saw the topic, it seemed impossible. But after months of hard work and figuring things out, I not only finished it but even got results that surprised me. It showed me that sticking with it can turn tough times into chances for growth.

## 挫折

Maybe it's my positive attitude or just luck, but I don't remember facing any big problems in life. Things have usually gone smoothly, even when challenges came up - I guess I've always managed to find a way through them.

## 为什么考研

Since I major in cybersecurity in college, I have a solid foundation and stay really interested in it. I want to keep learning and digging deeper into this area, so I decided to apply here. I think with the help of professors here, I can make even bigger progress in this field.

## 读研规划

First, I'll work hard to study and master the knowledge, making sure to finish all the tasks my professors assign. And then I will aim to publish my own research papers as soon as possible, and finish every project. If I develop a strong research skills, I'd love to pursue a PhD.

## 最喜欢的课程

My favorite course is Computer Networks. It taught me the layered architecture of the internet and all the logical designs. I love how each layer solves a problem and turning chaos into order. This course shaped my systematic thinking: breaking complex systems into layers. And I now use this kind of thinking method in debugging and designing programs.

## 最喜欢的老师

My favorite teacher is Professor Zhang. He’s quite approachable and patient. His lectures are super detailed, breaking down complex topics into steps that can be easily understood. And he never brushes off a single question in class. Once, he helped me debug a network project for hours. For me, he’s a mentor rather than just a teacher.

## 研究方向

In grad school, I want to focus on **homomorphic encryption** – a technology that lets you analyze data without ever decrypting it. It’s like solving a puzzle inside a sealed box!

Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) allows you to perform computations directly on encrypted data, so it can be used in scenarios like cloud computing to protect personal data privacy.

## 研究方向的应用场景

Homomorphic encryption has some real-world uses. For example, hospitals could analyze patient data without seeing names, keeping privacy intact. Banks might detect fraud in encrypted transactions without exposing account details. Even cloud servers could crunch numbers on locked files, giving results without accessing the data. It’s like solving puzzles in a sealed box – you get answers while keeping secrets safe.

## 我的家庭

I'm from a small family of three - just my parents and me. My dad is an architect and my mom works as an insurance salesperson. They're super supportive and show me lots of love.

## 为什么考复旦

Since I majored in Cryptography in college, I've stayed really interested in this field. I want to keep learning and doing research here. Fudan University has a top reputation in computer science, and I've admired here since I was a child. That's why I applied. I think with the professors' guidance, I can excel in my studies and make real progress.

## GPA

My GPA is 79 out of 100, and I’m in the top 50% of my program. Our university uses a 100-point grading scale, so a 79 is considered a, maybe B+ equivalent.

## 线性表（linear list）

A linear list is a data structure where elements are arranged in a sequential order, allowing each element to have  predecessor and successor. It supports operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal. Examples include arrays and linked lists.

## 数组（array）

An array is a contiguous block of memory storing elements of the same data type. And elements can be accessed by index.

## 链表（Linked List）

A collection of nodes linked by pointers, each containing data and a reference to the next node.

## 栈（stack）

A Last-In-First-Out data structure with operations like push, pop, and you can view the top element.

## 队列（queue）

A First-In-First-Out data structure with operations like enqueue, dequeue, and you can view the front element.

## 树（tree）

A tree is a hierarchical data structure with a root node and subtrees connected by edges. Each node (except the root) has one parent and zero or more children.

## 二叉树（binary tree）

A tree where each node has at most two children.

## Binary Search Tree (BST)

A binary tree where: left subtree values are little than root value, and right subtree values are bigger than root value.

## 平衡树（balanced tree）

A binary tree where the height difference of two subtree of a node is one or zero.

## 哈夫曼树（huffman tree）

A weighted binary tree used for optimal data compression (Huffman coding).

## TCP三次握手 + 四次挥手

TCP uses 3 steps to connect: SYN (client), SYN-ACK (server), ACK (client). For closure: FIN (client), ACK (server), FIN (server), ACK (client). Handshake syncs connections; termination ensures all data is sent, with TIME_WAIT preventing duplicate packets in new.
