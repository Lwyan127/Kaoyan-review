## 自我介绍

Good afternoon. Dear teachers! It is my honor to be here and take this interview. My name is xxx. I am a senior student from Huazhong University of Science and Technology and major in Cryptography.

During my undergraduate years, I studied hard and actively participated in volunteer service and was awarded  the MingDe Scholarship. Because I studied cybersecurity and cryptography in college, I have a foundation and interest in it. I want to continue learning and researching in this field. Fudan University has a high level in the field of computer science, and I have admired for a long time. So I chose to apply for Fudan University. I believe that through the guidance of teachers, I can achieve better results.

I think I am a conscientious [ˌkɒnʃiˈenʃəs] and responsible person. When teachers or teammates assigned me tasks, I always tried my best to complete them. And I have a great desire to acquire knowledge. When I am studying or doing something, I will be very focused. After studying, I often play play basketball and listen to music to relax myself.

## 毕业设计（graduation thesis）

The topic of my graduation thesis /ˈθiːsɪs/ is acceleration of NTT algorithm based on GPU. I reduced the iterative /ˈɪtərətɪv/ dependency in the NTT algorithm by modifying its structure, and then I used a hybrid method of single-core and multi-core calls to accelerate the NTT algorithm.

## 志愿服务（volunteer services）

I participated in many volunteer services during my college years, including volunteering for the centenary [senˈtiːnəri] of the founding of the Communist Party of China, collecting and organizing old books in dormitories, and so on.

## 家乡

I grew up in Shanghai, so I don't remember much about my family's hometown. Shanghai is a lively global city in eastern China, where modern skyscrapers stand alongside historic buildings. It's famous for its 'Haipai' culture that combines Chinese traditions with Western styles. Visitors love places like Yuyuan Garden and the busy Nanjing Road. The city also hosts big international events, showing how East and West come together in food, art, and new ideas.

## 母校（old school）

Huazhong University of Science and Technology is in Wuhan, Hubei Province. When I first arrived, two things stood out: how huge the campus was and how green it was everywhere. The environment is really nice - I love biking along the tree-lined avenues. The teachers are dedicated in class and also super friendly to students.

## 爱好

I love playing basketball because it keeps me fit and I enjoy competing with friends. Plus, music is my go-to-way for relax - it always boosts my mood and puts me in a good vibe.

## 为什么喜欢篮球

What I really love is the teamwork aspect. On the court, everyone has to work together, pass the ball, and support each other to win. Plus, there’s so much energy in the game – the fast pace and excitement never get old.

## 缺点

One of my weaknesses is that I'm naturally shy, so I get nervous when facing a lot of people.

## 成功

The best thing I did in college was definitely my graduation project. When I first saw the topic, it seemed impossible - like trying to climb a huge mountain. But after months of hard work and figuring things out, I not only finished it but even got results that surprised me. It showed me that sticking with it can turn tough times into chances for growth.

## 挫折

Maybe it's my positive attitude or just luck, but I don't remember facing any big problems in life. Things have usually gone smoothly, even when challenges came up - I guess I've always managed to find a way through them.

## 为什么考研

Since I majored in cybersecurity in college, I built a solid foundation and stayed really interested in it. I want to keep learning and digging deeper into this area, so I decided to apply to Fudan University. I think with the help of professors there, I can make even bigger progress in this field.

## 读研规划

First, I'll work hard to study and master the knowledge, making sure to finish all the tasks my professors assign. Also, during my master's program, I plan to keep improving myself - I hope to learn more and develop new skills that'll help me grow both academically and professionally.

## 研究方向

In grad school, I want to focus on **homomorphic encryption** – a super cool tech that lets you analyze data *without ever decrypting it*. Imagine being able to run calculations on locked files, and only the final answer gets unlocked. It’s like solving a puzzle inside a sealed box!

## 研究方向的应用场景

Homomorphic encryption has super cool real-world uses. For example, hospitals could analyze patient data without seeing names, keeping privacy intact. Banks might detect fraud in encrypted transactions without exposing account details. Even cloud servers could crunch numbers on locked files, giving results without accessing the data. It’s like solving puzzles in a sealed box – you get answers while keeping secrets safe. This tech could transform healthcare, finance, and AI by letting us use data and protect it at the same time!

## 我的家庭

I'm from a small family of three - just my parents and me. Both my mom and dad are high school teachers. They're super supportive and always teach me new things while showing me lots of love.

## 为什么考复旦

Since I majored in Cryptography in college, I've stayed really interested in this field. I want to keep learning and doing research here. Fudan University has a top reputation in computer science, and I've respected its work for ages. That's why I applied. I think with the professors' guidance, I can excel in my studies and make real progress.
